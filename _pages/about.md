My name is Mohammad Rezaei Sharifabadi. I am an IT Engineering graduate from the Amirkabir University of Technology. In my professional career path, I have a 6 month internship experience in the Network Support field. In 2020, I joined the HR team in Alibaba Travels Company(the pioneer of online travel services in Iran). But, recently I've changed my position to Associate Product Owner in the CSX team.
